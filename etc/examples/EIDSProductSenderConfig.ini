##
## This is the EIDSProductSender configuration
##
## The EIDSProductSender receives EIDS messages from the local EIDS hub.
## Internally, it uses the EIDSProductBuilder to build and receive products from those messages.
## The configured listeners listen for built products, and send them to the product hubs.
